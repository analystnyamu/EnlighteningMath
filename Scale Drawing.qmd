## Bearing and Distance, Angles of Elevation and Depression

**Types of bearing**

-   **True Bearing**- It can only measured from North pole in a
    clockwise direction and given in three digits format. For example
    given that $065^0$ is the bearing between two points, say $A$ from
    $B$; the angle is obtained at point $B$ from north pole in a
    clockwise direction to the line joining $A$.

-   **Compass bearing**- It can be measured from either North or South
    pole in either clockwise or anticlockwise direction depending on the
    side the target object is located. For example if point $A$ is
    $60^0$ North-West of point $B$, then point $A$ is on a compass
    bearing of $N60^0W$ from point $B$.

bearing of 0400 from town A. Town C is 100 km on a bearing of 1300 from
town B.

(b) i\. $\angle ABC ??? 40^0 + 50^0 = 90^0$

Label\,2 &\Rightarrow &\frac{1}{\cancel2}\times \cancelto{60}{120}\times(160+80)&=14,400\,m^2\\
Label\,3 &\Rightarrow &\frac{1}{\cancel2}\times \cancelto{70}{140} \times (120+160)&=19,600 \,m^2\\
Label\,4 &\Rightarrow &\frac{1}{\cancel2} \times \cancelto{20}{40}\times 120&=2,400 \,m^2\\
Label \,5 &\Rightarrow &\frac{1}{\cancel2}\times \cancelto{40}{80}\times100&=4,000 \,m^2\\
Label \, 6 &\Rightarrow &\frac{1}{\cancel2}\times \cancelto{20}{40}\times (100+180)&=5,600\,m^2\\
Label \, 7 &\Rightarrow &\frac{1}{\cancel2}\times \cancelto{50}{100}\times(180+120)&=15,000\,m^2\\
