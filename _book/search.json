Secondary Mathematics Revision Book One has been developed to meet the objectives indicated in the new syllabus. We wrote this book with students in mind; Mathematics is pertinent to all aspects of life since it makes our life orderly and prevents chaos. Eminent qualities that are nurtured by mathematics include the Power of reasoning, creativity, abstract or spatial thinking, critical thinking, problem-solving ability, and even effective communication skills. The book is organized in an accessible style; we have introduced each topic with well-solved examples. Each topic ends with questions, and problems to solve that are related to it with their answers at the back of the book. The book is divided into four sections; the first section introduces each topic with its problems to solve, section two gives 10 model sample papers with the K.C.S.E format, section three articulates answers to questions in each topic while section four displays answers to model sample papers."

    "text": "Decimals, Squares, and Square Roots\nDecimal fraction (Decimal), is a fraction whose denominator can be written as a power of \\(10\\), e.g.\\(\\frac{1}{10},\\,\\frac{3}{100}, and\\,\\frac{50}{100}\\).\nDecimal fractions are usually written in a special way, e.g., \\(\\frac{3}{10}\\) written as \\(0.3\\). The dot in this notation is called the decimal point. A decimal fraction that represents the sum of a whole number and a proper fraction is called a mixed decimal. In division, a decimal fraction in which a digit or a group of digits repeat continuously without ending is called a recurring decimal e.g. \\(\\frac{5}{11}\\)= 0.4545…, in short, we place dots above the digits that recurs e.g. 0.4545…written as \\(0.\\dot{4}\\dot{5}\\) A number is said to be in standard form if it is expressed in the form \\(A\\times 10^n\\) where \\(1\\leq A&lt;10\\) and \\(n\\) is an integer e.g. \\(0.0065\\) is written in standard form as \\(6.5\\times 10^{-3}\\).\nSquares of numbers are tabulated and can be read from the table of squares which gives only approximate values of the square to four figures.\nSquare root of a number can be obtained using the factorization method or tables of square roots in a mathematical table."

In stating the ratio the unit must be the same.\nProportion, is a comparison of two or more ratios. For example, if a, b, and c are three numbers such that $ a:b:c = 3:5:7$ then a, b, and c are said to be proportional to 3, 5, and 7 and the relationship should be integrated to mean \\(\\frac{a}{3}=\\frac{b}{5}=\\frac{c}{7}\\).

For example given that \\(065^0\\) is the bearing between two points, say \\(A\\) from \\(B\\); the angle is obtained at point \\(B\\) from north pole in a clockwise direction to the line joining \\(A\\).\nCompass bearing- It can be measured from either North or South pole in either clockwise or anticlockwise direction depending on the side the target object is located. For example if point \\(A\\) is \\(60^0\\) North-West of point \\(B\\), then point \\(A\\) is on a compass bearing of \\(N60^0W\\) from point \\(B\\)."
