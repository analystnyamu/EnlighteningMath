# Chapter Eleven: Mass, Weight and Density

# Mass, Weight and Density {.unnumbered}

\textbf{Mass}, is the quantity of matter in an object? The Mass of an
object is constant everywhere. Its SI unit is Kilogram (K.g).

\textbf{Weight}, is the pull of the earth on an object. The weight of an
object varies from one place to another on the earth's surface. Its SI
unit is Newton (N). It is given by mass multiplied by the gravitational
force (g).

$Weight (N) = mass (kg) \times gravity (N/kg).$

\textbf{Density}, is mass per unit volume. Its SI unit is Kilogram per
Cubic meter ($kgm^-3$)

$$Density= \frac{mass}{volume}$$
$$Density \,of\, mixture=\frac{mass \,of\, mixture}{volume\, of \,mixture} $$

## Conversion of Units

$$
\begin{split}
1 \,tonne &= 1,000\, Kilograms\\
1 \,kilogram &= 1,000 \,grams\\
1g/cm^3& = 1,000 Kg/m^3
\end{split}

## Solved Examples

## Example 1

2.5 litres of water of density $1g/cm^3$ is added to 4 litres of alcohol
of density $0.8 g/cm^3$. Calculate in 3 significant figures, the density
of the mixture in its SI unit. \hspace{4.2 cm} (3mks)
:::

::: {.callout-caution collapse="true"}
## Solution

$$Density \,of \,Mixture (D.M)=\frac{Mass\, of\,mixture}{Volume\, of \,mixture}$$

$$
\begin{split}
Volume \,of \,water&=2,500 cm^3 \\
Mass \,of\, water&=(2,500 cm^3\times 1g/cm^3)\\
&=2,500g&\\
Volume\, of\, alcohol&=4,000 cm^3\\
Mass \,of \,alcohol&=(4,000 cm^3 \times 0.8g/cm^3)\\
&=3,200g
\end{split}
$$

$$
\begin{split}
Mass\, of\, Mixture&=(2,500g+3,200g)\\&=5,700g\\
Volume\, of \,mixture&=(2,500 cm^3+4,000 cm^3)\\&=6,500 cm^3\\
\therefore D.M&=\frac{5,7\cancel{0}\cancel{0}}{6,5\cancel{0}\cancel{0}}\\&=0.8769 g/cm^3\\
&=877 Kg/m^3
\end{split}
$$

## Example 2

wo coils of the same mass are made by winding zinc of different gauges
and lengths. The first coil is made by winding 648 m of wire with a
cross-sectional diameter of 5.4mm and the second coil is made by winding
450 m with different cross-sections. Find the cross-sectional radius of
the second coil. $(3mks)$
:::

::: {.callout-caution collapse="true"}
## Solution

\textbf{Note:} Since mass is proportional to volume for the same
density, the volume of the first coil is equal to volume of the second
coil. $$
\begin{align*}
First\, coil \,volume:\\
\frac{22}{7}\times \left(\frac{5.4}{2}\right)^2\times 648,000&=14,846,605.71 \,mm^3\\
Second \,coil \,volume:\\
\frac{22}{7}\times r^2\times 450,000&=1,414,285.714r^2 \,mm^3\\
Second \,coil \,volume&=First\, coil \,volume\\
1,414,285.714r^2 \,mm^3&=14,846,605.71 \,mm^3\\
\frac{\cancel{1,414,285.714}r^2}
{\cancel{1,414,285.714}}&=\frac{\cancelto{10.4976}{14,846,605.71}}{\cancel{1,414,285.714}}\\r^2&=10.4976 \,mm^2\\
\therefore r&=3.24\, mm
\end{align*}

## Example 3

The external measurements of a closed metal box are 1.6 m long, 0.7 m
wide, and 0.4 m high. The metal used in making box is 1.0 cm thick and
has a density of 0.85 g/cm3. If the box contains 40 packets of 12
similar tools each and each tool has a mass of 115 g, calculate:

```{=tex}
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item The volume of metal used in making the box.   \hspace{7cm}        $(4mks)$
\item The mass of the empty box in Kilograms to 3 significant figures.      \hspace{4cm}    $(3mks)$
\item The total mass of the box in kilograms to 3 significant figures.      \hspace{4.5cm}      $(3mks)$
\end{enumerate}
```

::: {.callout-caution collapse="true"}
## Solution

```{=tex}
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item 
\begin{align*}
\textbf{Volume of the Cuboid (v):} \\
v&=Length\times Width\times Height\\
\textbf{External\, Measurement: }\\
Length&=160 cm\\
Width&=70 cm\\
Height&=40 cm\\
\textbf{Internal\, Measurement:} \\
thickness&=1 cm\\
Length&=158 cm\\
\end{align*}

\begin{align*}
Width&=68 cm\\
Height&=38 cm\\ \textbf{External\, volume:} \\
160\times 70\times 40&=448,000\,cm^3\\ \textbf{Internal\, Volume:}\\
158\times 68 \times 38&=408,272\,cm^3\\
448,000\,cm^3-408,272\,cm^3&=39,728\,cm^3\\ \therefore Volume\, of\,the\,metal&=39,728 \,cm^3
\end{align*}

\item 
\begin{align*}
Mass&=density\times volume\\
&=0.85 g/cm^3\times 39,728 cm^3\\ 
&=33,768.8g\\
\frac{33,768.8}{1000}&=33.7688 \,Kg\\
\therefore Mass \,of\, the\, empty \,box&=33.8\,Kg
\end{align*}

\item 
\begin{align*}
Mass\: of \:tools:\\
12\times 40 \times 115&=55,200\, g\\
 \frac{55,200}{1000}&=55.2 \, Kg\\
\therefore The\: total\: Mass&=55.2+33.8\\
&=89.0 \,Kg
\end{align*}
