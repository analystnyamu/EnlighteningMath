# Chapter Nine: Rate, Ratio, Proportion, and Percentage {.unnumbered}

## Rate, Ratio, Proportion, and Percentage {.unnumbered}

**Rate**, is a comparison of one quantity with another of a different
kind. If a van takes three hours to travel a distance of $180 \,Km$,
then the van is traveling at an average rate of $60 \,Km/hr$.

**Ratio**, is a way of comparing two similar quantities. If John is 7
years old and his sister Jane is 16 years old, then John's age is
$\frac{7}{16}$ of Jane's age and the ratio of their ages is 7:16. In
stating the ratio the unit must be the same.

**Proportion**, is a comparison of two or more ratios. For example, if
a, b, and c are three numbers such that \$ a:b:c = 3:5:7\$ then a, b,
and c are said to be proportional to 3, 5, and 7 and the relationship
should be integrated to mean $\frac{a}{3}=\frac{b}{5}=\frac{c}{7}$. In
the same way,\$ a:b =3:5, b:c = 5:7,\$ and $a:c = 3:7$.

## Example 1

If ,$a:b=3:5$ and $b:c=7:9$, Find the ratio: $a:c$. \hspace{6.5 cm}
$(3mks)$
:::

::: {.callout-caution collapse="true"}
## Solution

$a:b=3:5$

$b:c=7:9$

$$
\begin{matrix}
  a&:&b&:&c \\
  7(3&:&5)\\
  \,&\,&\,(7&:&9)5\\ \\
  a&:&b&:&c \\
  21&:&35&:&45\\
 \end{matrix}
$$ $\therefore \, a:c=21:45$

## Example 2

Twelve laborers each working six hours a day, take twelve days to plough
a piece of land. How long would it take 24 laborers each working 9 hours
a day to plough the same piece of land? \hspace{0.6cm} $(3mks)$
:::

::: {.callout-caution collapse="true"}
## Solution

$$
\begin{matrix}
  men&\,&hours&\,&days\\
  12&\,&6&\,&12\\
  24&\,&9&\,&?
 \end{matrix}
$$ ![](images/Ratio_Ex2.png)

$$Days\, needed: \cancelto{\frac{1}{2}}{\frac{12}{24}}\times\cancelto{\frac{2}{3}}{\frac{6}{9}}\times12=4$$
$\therefore$ The laborers would take $4$ days

$$
\begin{split}
Buying \,price (B.P) \Rightarrow \frac{45+80n}{1+n}&=100\%\\
Selling \,Price (S.P) \Rightarrow 90&=120\%\\
B.P \Rightarrow \frac{90\times 10\cancel{0}}{12\cancel{0}}&=75\\
\frac{45+80n}{1+n}&=75\\
\end{split}
$$

$$
\begin{split}
45+80n&=75+75n \\5n&=30\\
\frac{\cancel{5}n}{\cancel5}&=\frac{\cancelto{6}{30}}{\cancel5}\\
\frac{n}{1}&=\frac{6}{1}\\
\Rightarrow \frac{1}{n}&=\frac{1}{6}\\
\therefore 1:n&=1:6

## Example 4

A cold water tap can fill a bath in 15 minutes while a hot water tap can
fill it in 10 minutes. The drainage pipe can empty it in 8 minutes. The
cold water and hot water taps are opened for 2 minutes. After two
minutes all three taps are opened. Find the total time taken to fill the
bath. \hspace {14.8 cm} $(3 mks)$
:::

::: {.callout-caution collapse="true"}
## Solution

**The 3 taps rate of filling the bath in 1 min:**

```{=latex}
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\text{Cold water tap} & = \frac{1}{15} \\ 
\text{Hot water tap} & = \frac{1}{10} \\ 
\text{Drainage tap} & = \frac{1}{8} \\ 
\\
\textbf{Fraction by hot and cold tap in 2 min:} \\ 
\left( \frac{1}{15} + \frac{1}{10} \right) \cdot 2 & = \frac{1}{3} 
\end{split}
\end{equation}
```

**Fraction of water unfilled**:

$$\Rightarrow 1-\frac{1}{3}=\frac{2}{3}$$

**Fraction of water by 3 taps in 1 min:**

$$\frac{1}{15}+\frac{1}{10}-\frac{1}{8}=\frac{1}{24}$$

**Time to fill the remaining water:**

$$\frac{2}{3}\div \frac{1}{24}\Rightarrow \frac{2}{\cancel{3}} \times \cancel{24}^8=16 $$

$\therefore$ Total time $\Rightarrow 16+2=18$ min.
