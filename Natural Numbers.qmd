# Chapter 1: Natural Numbers {.unnumbered}

## Natural Numbers {.unnumbered}

Natural Numbers are also called **Counting numbers**. They consist of
$0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,$ $and\, 9$ digits. Place value is the
position of a digit in a number. Total value is the product of the digit
and its place value. A prime number is a number with only two factors
that is, one and it's self. e.g $\,2, 3, 5, 7, 11.$

Odd numbers are numbers ending with the digits: $1, 3, 5, 7, or \,9.$

Even numbers are numbers ending with the digits: $0, 2, 4, 6, or\, 8.$

Let the digits be xyz

```{=latex}
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
y&=3z\\x&=4z\\
x+y+z&=16\\4z+3z+z&=16\\

## Example 1  

Njoroge had $2,568$ bags of beans each weighing $90 Kg$., he sold
$1,324$ of them.

a\) How many kilograms of beans were left? $(2mks)$

b\) If he added 632 more bags of beans, how many kilograms of beans did
he end up being with? $(2mks)$
:::  


::: {.callout-caution collapse="true"}
## Solution

a\) One bag of beans weighs 90 Kg. $$
\begin{split}
2,568~bags~weighs~&=90\times2,568 \\ 
&=231,120~Kg\\
1,324~bags~weighs~&=90\times 1,324\\
&=119,160~Kg\\
Amount~of~beans~left~ &=231,120-119,160\\
&=111,960~Kg
\end{split}
$$

b\) 

$$
\begin{split}
(632\times90) + 111,960\,Kg
&=56,880+111,960 \\ & =168,840\,Kg.

## Example 3

The Amos family borrows \$ 20,880 to purchase a new car at a special 0%
interest rate. The car dealer allows them 5 years to pay back the amount
they borrow and requires equal monthly payments. How much are their
monthly payments? $(2mks)$
:::

::: {.callout-caution collapse="true"}
## Solution

Since there are 12 months in each year, they must make a total of
$5\times12 = 60$, payments on the loan. Dividing \$ 20,880 by 60 will
result in the monthly payment:

![Example 3](images/Operations_Ex3.png)

The Amos' monthly payment will be \$ 348.
