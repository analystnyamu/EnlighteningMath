    "text": "Preface\nThe book was written in unison with the objectives of the secondary system of education. Secondary Mathematics Revision Book One has been developed to meet the objectives indicated in the new syllabus. We wrote this book with students in mind; Mathematics is pertinent to all aspects of life since it makes our life orderly and prevents chaos. Eminent qualities that are nurtured by mathematics include the Power of reasoning, creativity, abstract or spatial thinking, critical thinking, problem-solving ability, and even effective communication skills. The book is organized in an accessible style; we have introduced each topic with well-solved examples. Each topic ends with questions, and problems to solve that are related to it with their answers at the back of the book. The book is divided into four sections; the first section introduces each topic with its problems to solve, section two gives 10 model sample papers with the K.C.S.E format, section three articulates answers to questions in each topic while section four displays answers to model sample papers."

Although the book is written primarily for the secondary school mathematics syllabus, it can also be useful to students undertaking similar courses both within and outside Kenya. The book precisely introduces each topic in an understandable summarized manner; incorporated with elaborate examples anticipated to exhibit simple mathematical ideas that are offered as a precursor to a wide range of questions after every topic. It ensures that even weak students can simply understand the calculations and apply the skills to the problems provided after the topic. The Model Sample Papers are articulated in a KCSE mode"

    "text": "Decimals, Squares, and Square Roots\nDecimal fraction (Decimal), is a fraction whose denominator can be written as a power of \\(10\\), e.g.\\(\\frac{1}{10},\\,\\frac{3}{100}, and\\,\\frac{50}{100}\\).\nDecimal fractions are usually written in a special way, e.g., \\(\\frac{3}{10}\\) written as \\(0.3\\). The dot in this notation is called the decimal point. A decimal fraction that represents the sum of a whole number and a proper fraction is called a mixed decimal. In division, a decimal fraction in which a digit or a group of digits repeat continuously without ending is called a recurring decimal e.g. \\(\\frac{5}{11}\\)= 0.4545…, in short, we place dots above the digits that recurs e.g. 0.4545…written as \\(0.\\dot{4}\\dot{5}\\) A number is said to be in standard form if it is expressed in the form \\(A\\times 10^n\\) where \\(1\\leq A&lt;10\\) and \\(n\\) is an integer e.g. \\(0.0065\\) is written in standard form as \\(6.5\\times 10^{-3}\\).\nSquares of numbers are tabulated and can be read from the table of squares which gives only approximate values of the square to four figures.\nSquare root of a number can be obtained using the factorization method or tables of square roots in a mathematical table."

    "text": "Co-Ordinates and Graphs\nA coordinate is an ordered pair of numbers used to locate the position of a point in a plane and written in the form (x, y). The first number, x represents the distance along the x-axis and it is called x the coordinate. The second number, y represents the distance along the y-axis and it is called the y coordinate.\nThe x and y axes divide the plane into four regions and each region is called a quadrant. The quadrants are named 1st quadrant, 2nd quadrant, 3rd quadrant, and 4th quadrant starting with the top right-hand quadrant and moving in anti-clockwise direction.\nRectangular Cartesian co-ordinate system is a system of locating points using two axes at right angles.\nWe can also use coordinate systems such as latitude and longitudes and grid references to locate places on the earth’s surface."
