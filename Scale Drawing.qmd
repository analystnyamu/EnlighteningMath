## Bearing and Distance, Angles of Elevation and Depression

**Types of bearing**

-   **True Bearing**- It can only measured from North pole in a
    clockwise direction and given in three digits format. For example
    given that $065^0$ is the bearing between two points, say $A$ from
    $B$; the angle is obtained at point $B$ from north pole in a
    clockwise direction to the line joining $A$.

-   **Compass bearing**- It can be measured from either North or South
    pole in either clockwise or anticlockwise direction depending on the
    side the target object is located. For example if point $A$ is
    $60^0$ North-West of point $B$, then point $A$ is on a compass
    bearing of $N60^0W$ from point $B$.

## Solved Examples

# Example 1

Three towns A, B, and C are situated such that town B is 40km on a
bearing of 0400 from town A. Town C is 100 km on a bearing of 1300 from
town B.

(a) Draw a sketch showing the positions of towns A, B, and C. $(1mk)$

(b) Calculate:

    i\. The size of angle ABC $(1mk)$

    ii\. The distance of C from A to 1 decimal place $(2mk)$

(b) i\. $\angle ABC ??? 40^0 + 50^0 = 90^0$

    ii\. $$AC^2 = AB^2 + BC^2$$ $$AC^2 = 40^2 + 100^2$$
    $$AC^2 = 11,600$$ $$AC = 107.7\,Km$$

# Example 2

A dove flies from a tree A to another tree B which is $80\, m$ on a
bearing of $060^0$ from A. From B the dove flies $100\, m$ to tree C
which is on a compass bearing of $S40^0E$ from tree B and finally flies
due south to another tree D which is on a bearing of $1^0$ from A. a)
Using a ruler and a pair of compasses only construct an accurate scale
drawing showing the positions of A, B, C, and D.
$(scale : 1\, cm=10\, m)$

b\) By measurement from your scale drawing determine:

\(i\) The distance and compass bearing of A from C. $(2mks)$

\(ii\) The distance of D from C. $(1mks)$

\(iii\) The distance and compass bearing of A from D $(2mks)$

# Solution

\(a\)

\(b\)

\(i\) Distance of A from $C = 139 ± 1 m$ ;

Compass bearing of A from $C = N 75^0 ± 10 W$

\(ii\) Distance of D from $C = 58 ± 1m$

\(iii\) Distance of A from $D = 164 ± 1m$ ;

Compass bearing of A from $D = N 55^0 ± 10 W$

# Example 3

The angle of elevation of the top of a vertical tower from a point P is
$35^0$. The angle of elevation of the top of the tower from another
point Q which is nearer the foot R of the tower is $50^0$. The distance
between Q and P is $40\, m$ and the points P, Q, and R are on the same
straight line on level ground.

\(a\) Use a scale of 1cm to represent 10 m, draw an accurate scale
drawing to represent the above information. $(4mks)$

\(b\) Use your scale drawing to determine:

\(i\) The height of the tower $(2mks)$

\(ii\) The distance QP $(2mks)$

\(iii\) The distance of P from the top of the tower $(2mks)$

# Solution

\(a\)

\(b\)

\(i\) Height of the tower $= 68 ± 1m$

\(ii\) $RQ = 58 ± 1 m$

\(iii\) Distance of P from top of the tower $= 120 ± 1 m$
