## Geometrical Constructions {.unnumbered}

**Note:** To circumscribe a circle around a triangle, we bisect two
sides of the triangle and the point of intersection is the center of the
circle.

To inscribe a circle inside a triangle, we bisect two angles of the
triangle and the point of intersection is the center of the circle.

**Geometrical construction** is the drawing of accurate figures. The
figures are constructed using a pair of compasses and a ruler only

**Perpendicular Lines**

Figure 17.1 shows XY as a perpendicular bisector of a given line AB

![Figure 17.1: Perpendicular Bisector](figures/Images/FIG1.png)

Figure 17.2 shows PR, a perpendicular from point P to a given line AB.

Point](figures/Images/FIG2.png)

**Constructing Angles of**
$60\,^{\circ}, \,120\,^{\circ},\, and \,30\,^{\circ}$

In this section, we will consider the construction of some angles with
special sizes using a pair of compasses and a ruler only.

**Constructing a** $60^0$ **Angle**

**Step 1:** Draw the line AB.

**Step 2:** Place the tip of the compass at A and draw an arc of any
measure to cut the line AB at some point (say R).

**Step 3:** Keeping the width unchanged, place the tip of the compass on
point R and draw another arc cutting the arc drawn in the previous step
at some point (say S)

**Step 4:** Connect the points A and S with a straight line and extend
it to form a line AC.

The measure of the $\angle BAC$ is $60^0$

![Figure 17.3: An Angle of $60^0$](figures/Images/FIG3.png)

**Constructing a** $120^0$ **Angle**

**Step 1:** Draw the line AB. **{Step 2:** Place the tip of the compass
at A and draw an arc of any measure to cut the line AB at some point
(say P). **Step 3:** Keeping the width unchanged, place the tip of the
compass on point P and draw another arc cutting the arc drawn in the
previous step at some point (say S) **Step 4:** With the same width
place the tip of the compass at point S and draw another arc cutting the
arc drawn in step 2 at some point (say T) **Step 5:** Connect the points
A and T with a straight line and extend it to form a line AC.

The measure of the $\angle BAC$ is $120^0$

![Figure 17.4: An Angle of $120^0$](figures/Images/FIG4.png)

**Constructing a** $30^0$ **Angle**

To construct the angle of $30^0$, Construct the angle of $60^0$ as
described above and then bisect it as shown below.

The measure of the $\angle BAC$ is $30^0$
