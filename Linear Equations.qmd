## Linear Equations {.unnumbered}

Linear equations are equations of straight lines involving one or two
unknown variables. A system of two linear equations forms simultaneous
equations.

There are three methods used to solve simultaneous equations:

-   **Elimination method**
-   **Substitution method**
-   **Graphical method**

## Solved examples

### Substitution method

::: {.callout-note collapse="false"}
## Example 1

```{=latex}
\begin{align*}
2x - 3y & = -13 \quad \quad \quad (i) \\
y & = 2x + 7 \quad \quad \quad (ii)
\end{align*}
```
:::

::: {.callout-caution collapse="true"}
## Solution

Substituting equation **(ii)** into **(i)**;

```{=latex}
\begin{align*}
  2x - 3(2x + 7) & = -13 \\
  2x - 6x - 21 & = -13 \\
  -4x & = -13 + 21 \\
  \frac{\cancel{-4}x}{\cancel{-4}} & = \frac{\cancelto{-2}{8}}{\cancel{-4}} \\
  x & = -2 
\end{align*}
```

```{=latex}
  \begin{align*}
 but,\, y&=2x+7\\
 Solve\, for\, y:\\
 y&=2(-2)+7\\
 &=3\\ \therefore Solution \,set&=(-2,3)
 \end{align*}
```
:::

::: {.callout-note collapse="false"}
## Example 2

```{=latex}
\begin{align*}
7x + 15y &= 22...\hspace{2cm} (i)\\
8x + 17y &= 25...\hspace{2cm} (ii)\\
\end{align*}
```
:::

::: {.callout-caution collapse="true"}
## Solution

```{=latex}
\begin{align*}
Solving\, for\, x\, in \,(i);\\
x&=\frac{22-15y}{7}\\
substituting \,x=\frac{22-15y}{7} \,in \,(ii)\\
8\left(\frac{22-15y}{7}\right)+17y&=25\\
Multiplying \,both\, side\, by \,7;\\
176-120y+119y&=175\\
\cancel{-}y&=\cancel{-}1\\
y&=1\\ then \, , \,x&=\frac{22-15(1)}{7}\\
&x=1\\
\therefore Solution \,set&=(1,1)
\end{align*}
```

### Elimination method

::: {.callout-note collapse="false"}
## Example 3

```{=latex}
\begin{align*}
3x-7y&=13... \hspace{2cm} (i)\\
6x - 5y& = 8...  \hspace{2.1cm} (ii)
\end{align*}
```
:::

::: {.callout-caution collapse="true"}
## Solution

To eliminate x multiply equation (i) by 2 and (ii) by 1 and then
subtract (ii) from (i);

Plugging y=-2 in (i) or (ii) to determine the value of x;

```{=latex}
\begin{align*}
3x-7(-2)&=13\\
3x+14&=13\\3x&=-1\\
\frac{\cancel{3}x}{\cancel{3}}&=-\frac{1}{3}\\
x&=\frac{-1}{3}\\ Solution\, set&=(-\frac{1}{3},-2)
\end{align*}
```

## Example 4

Solve the following linear equations $(4mks)$

$$\frac{x+y}{6}-\frac{x+y}{4}=-\frac{1}{4}$$
$$\frac{x-y}{5} + \frac{x-y}{6}=1\frac{1}{10}$$
:::

::: {.callout-caution collapse="true"}
## Solution

Simplifying the two equations;

Multiply the 1st equation by 12;

$$\left(\frac{x+y}{6}-\frac{x+y}{4}=\frac{-1}{4}\right)12$$
$$2x+2y-3x-3y=-3$$ $$-x-y=-3 \,\ldots \ldots\ldots(i)$$

Multiply the 2nd equation by 30;

$$\left(\frac{x-y}{5}+\frac{x-y}{6}=\frac{11}{10}\right)30$$
$$6x-6y+5x-5y=33$$

$$11x-11y=33 \, \ldots\ldots\ldots (ii)$$

Multiply equation (i) by 11 and add to equation (ii) to eliminate x;

![](images/Li_eq_Ex4.png)

Plugging $y= 0$ in (i) or (ii) to determine the value of x;

```{=latex}
\begin{align*}
-x-y(0)&=-3\\
-x&=-3\\x&=3\\
\therefore Solution \,set&=(3,0)
\end{align*}
```

4.  Mercy a student at Mucagara mixed Secondary bought 5 pens and 3
    exercise books from Magunas supermarket at Ksh. 135, at the same
    time Murugi her class mate also bought 4 pens and 5 exercise books
    and spent Ksh. 25 more than Mercy. Find the cost of each pen and
    exercise book.  $(4mks)$

5.  In July, Kiama donated $\frac{1}{6}$th of his salary to a children's
    home while Joshua donated $\frac{1}{5}$th of his salary to the same
    children's home. Their total donation for July was $Ksh.\, 14,820$.
    In August, Kiama donated $\frac{1}{8}$th of his salary to the
    children's home while Joshua donated $\frac{1}{12}$th of his salary

    Enoch. Alex had as many cows as John, whereas Jeff had 10 cows less
    than the sum of both John and Alex.

    a\) Write a simplified expression with one variable, representing
    the total number of cows.  $(1mk)$

    each butcher got 17 cows, how many did Jeff sell to the butchers
     $(3mks)$

10. Wanjiru bought three cups and four plates for Ksh. 324. Moraa bought
    five cups and Anyango bought two plates of the same type as those

    same shop. Daniel bought 2 pens and 3 blades for $Ksh.\, 78$. Sokoro
    bought 3 pens and 4 blades and spent $Ksh.\, 36$ more than Daniel.
    Calculate the cost of each item  $(3mks)$

    a\) Find the price of each item. $(3mks)$

    b\) Naomi spent Ksh. 228 to buy the same type of pencils and blades.
    If the number of blades she bought was 4 more than the number of
    pencils, find the number of pencils bought.  $(3mks)$

13. A retailer bought 50 plates and 30 spoons from a wholesaler P for
    $Ksh.\, 4260$. Had she bought 15 plates less and half spoons more,
    she would have paid $Ksh. \,990$ less. Had the retailer bought from
    wholesaler Q, she would have paid 50% more for a plate and 25% less
    for a spoon. How much would she have lost if she had bought the 50
    plates and the 30 spoons from wholesaler Q.?     $(10mks)$
