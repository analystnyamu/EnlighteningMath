# Preface {.unnumbered}

This book is aligned with the objectives of the secondary education system. **Secondary Mathematics Revision Volume 1 Book** has been developed to meet the goals outlined in the new syllabus, keeping students' needs in mind. Mathematics plays a critical role in everyday life, helping create order and prevent chaos. It nurtures key qualities such as reasoning skills, creativity, abstract and spatial thinking, critical thinking, problem-solving ability, and effective communication.

The book is organized in a clear and accessible style. Each topic begins with well-explained examples and ends with related questions and problems to solve, with answers provided at the back. The book is divided into four sections: the first introduces each topic along with practice problems; the second presents 10 model sample papers following the **K.C.S.E** format; the third provides answers to the topic-specific questions; and the fourth section includes answers to the model sample papers.
