# Chapter Fourteen: Commercial Arithmetic

# Commercial Arithmetic {.unnumbered}

Currency is the medium of any business transaction. In Kenya, shillings
are used as the basic currency unit. 1 Kenyan shilling $(Ksh)$ is equal
to 100 cents $(ct)$.

## Solved Examples

::: {.callout-note collapse="false"}
# Example 1

Use the exchange rates below to answer this question. \hspace{6cm}
$(3mks)$

$\hspace{5.1cm} Buying\hspace{2.9cm} Selling$

1 US dollar $\hspace{3.3cm}102.20 \hspace{3cm} 102.80$

1 UK £ $\hspace{4cm}132.30 \hspace{3cm} 132.95$

A European tourist arriving in Kenya from Britain had 12,600 UK Sterling
pounds (£). He converted the pounds to Kenya shillings at a
commission of 5%. While in Kenya, he spent $\frac{4}{5}$ of this money.
He changed the balance to US dollars after his stay. If he was not
charged any commission for this last transaction, calculate to the
nearest US dollars, the amount he received.

# Solution

To Convert foreign currency to Kenyan currency, the bank Buys from you
(use the Buying column. But, from Kenyan currency to foreign currency,
the bank sells to you (use the Selling column)

$$
\begin{align*}
He\, received &=12,500 \times 132.30 \\&=Ksh. 1,666,980\\
After \,commission,\, he \,gets:\\ &= \frac{95}{100}\times 1,666,980\\&=1,583,631\\
\end{align*}
$$ 
Balance after spending $\frac{4}{5}$ of his money:

$$
 \begin{align*}
 &=\frac{1}{5}\times 1,583,631\\&=Ksh.\, 237,667.20 \\US\, dollars\, he\, received: \\
&=\frac{237,667.20}{102.80}\\&=2,311.94\\
 \therefore He \,received: \,2,312 \,US \,dollars 
\end{align*}

# Example 2

A Kenyan bank buys and sells foreign currencies at the exchange rates
shown below.

$\hspace{5.1cm} BUYING \,(KSH) \hspace{2.6cm} SELLING \,(KSH)$

1Euro $\hspace{4.4cm} 147.56 \hspace{4.6cm} 148.00$

1U.S Dollar $\hspace{3.5cm} 102.22 \hspace{4.6cm} 102.50$

A foreign woman arrived in Kenya with 25,000 Euros. He converted all the
Euros into Kenyan Shillings at the bank. He spent $Ksh.\, 2, 610,200$
while in Kenya and converted the remaining Kenya shillings into U.S
Dollars at the bank. Calculate to the nearest dollars the amount that
she received. \hspace{15.2cm} $(3mks)$
:::

::: {.callout-caution collapse="true"}
# Solution

$$
\begin{align*}
She\, received&=25000\times 147.56\\&=Ksh. 3,689,000\\ Balance \,after \,spending:\\
&= 3,689,000-2, 610,200\\&=Ksh. 1,078,800\\
  US \,dollars \,she \,received:\\
&=\frac{1,078,800}{102.5}\\
&=10,524.88\\ \therefore \,She\, received: \,&10,525 \,US \,dollars

# Example 3

Mr. Albert who deals in electronics sells a radio to a customer at
$Ksh.\, 1,350$ after giving him a discount of 10% but finds that he
still makes a 20% profit. Find the percentage profit Mr. Albert would
make if he does not give a discount. \hspace{11cm} $(3mks)$
:::

::: {.callout-caution collapse="true"}
# Solution

$\textbf{Note:}$ The marked price and the Buying Price (B.P) are always
100%

Marked Price (M.P) of the radio: $$
\begin{align*}
\frac{1350\times 10\cancel{0}}{9\cancel{0}}&=Ksh.\: 1,500 \\Buying\, Price (B.P):\\ \frac{1,35\cancel{0}\times 100}{12\cancel{0}}&=Ksh. \:1,125
\end{align*}
$$

Profit gained if no discount was offered: $$
\begin{align*}
1,500-1,125&=Ksh. \:375
\end{align*}
$$

Percentage profit (P.P):

$$
\begin{align*}
&=\left(\frac{profit}{B.P}\right)\times 100\\
P.P&=\frac{375}{1,125}\times 100\\&=33.33\%
\end{align*}
$$ $\therefore$ He would make $33\frac{1}{3}\%$ profit

# Example 4

Judy bought some rice at the wholesale price of $Ksh.\, 65$ per kg. She
packed three-fifths of the rice in 2 kg bags and sold each bag at
$Ksh.\, 160$. She packed the remaining in 1 kg bags and sold each bag at
$Ksh.\, 85$. After selling all the rice she found that she had made a
profit of $Ksh. \, 6460$.

a\) Calculate the amount of rice she bought \hspace{8cm} $(6mks)$

b\) In three significant figures, determine:

i\) The percentage profit she made. \hspace{8.2cm} $(2mks)$

ii\) The percentage profit he would have made if sold all the rice in 2
kg bags. \hspace{1.5cm} $(2mks)$
:::

::: {.callout-caution collapse="true"}
# Solution

a\)

Let the amount of rice be $x$

$$
\begin{align*}
2Kg \,bags&=\frac{3}{5}x
\end{align*}
$$

Selling price (S.P) for 2kg bags:

$$
\begin{align*}
 &=\left(\frac{3}{5}x\right)\frac{160}{2}\\
 &=48x\\ 1Kg\, bags&=x-\frac{3}{5}x\\&=\frac{2}{5}x
 \end{align*}
$$

Selling price for 1Kg bags: $$
\begin{align*}
&=\frac{2}{5}x\times 85\\&=34x\\
Total \,selling \,price&=48x+34x\\&=82x
\end{align*}
$$

Buying Price (B.P) of the rice:

$$
\begin{align*}
&=65x\\
Profit&=S.P-B.P\\ 82x-65x&=6460 \\ \frac{\cancel{17}x}{\cancel{17}}&=\frac{\cancelto{380}{6460}}{\cancel{17}}\\&=380\\
\therefore The \,amount \,of \,Rice &=380 \,kg
\end{align*}
$$

b\) i) $$
\begin{align*}
Percentage\, profit (p.p)&=\frac{profit}{B.p}\times 100\\
B.p&=380\times 65\\&=24700\\
&=\left(\frac{6460}{247\cancel{00}}\right)\cancel{100}\\
&\approx 26.154\%\\
\therefore p.p&= 26.2\%
\end{align*}
$$

ii\)

$$
\begin{align*}
S.p&=\left(\frac{380}{2}\right)160\\&=30400\\
profit&=30,400-24,700\\&=5700\\
p.p&=\left(\frac{5700}{247\cancel{00}}\right)\cancel{100}\\ &\approx23.077\%\\
\therefore p.p&= 23.1\%
\end{align*}
